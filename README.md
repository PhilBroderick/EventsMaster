# EventsMaster
First exposure to an Angular application with .NET Core. Allows users to sign up and once verified create events. Other users can see these events and signup as long as they are verified.

Users can search for events close to them or for certain dates and sign up to these accordingly.

All features and enhancements are tracked through a trello board: https://trello.com/b/u7utD5FM/eventsmaster
